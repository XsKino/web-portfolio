                  My name is <strong>Andrés Piñón</strong>, a passionate software developer from Mexico.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Born in 2004. I've always been interested in technology, at the age of 12 I really got into game
                  development, not that I could do much since I didn't have a decent PC back then, but because of that, I
                  discovered that <strong>coding was something I really enjoyed</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you are wondering, <strong>Kino is just my nickname</strong>, you can call me that. ;)
                </p>`

                  I am <strong>very passionate about everything I do</strong>, I love working with other people, getting
                  the best out of them and myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Don't know if it's a good thing or not, but I'm a <strong>perfectionist</strong>, I always try to do
                  my best, always looking for ways to <strong>improve</strong>.

                  I discovered my love for coding through game development, so I really believe that, just as
                  videogames,
                  <strong>software development and engineering are a form of art</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Success is achievable through <strong>teamwork</strong> and <strong>love</strong>.
